# ### Introduction
# 
# A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.  It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these 
# 
# For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
# 
# **As you work through this notebook, follow along in the classroom and answer the corresponding quiz questions associated with each question.** The labels for each classroom concept are provided for each question.  This will assure you are on the right track as you work through the project, and you can feel more confident in your final submission meeting the criteria.  As a final check, assure you meet all the criteria on the [RUBRIC](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/37e27304-ad47-4eb0-a1ab-8c12f60e43d0/rubric).

# #### Part I - Probability
# 
# To get started, let's import our libraries.

# In[1]:


import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')
#We are setting the seed to assure you get the same answers on quizzes as we set up
random.seed(42)


# `1.` Now, read in the `ab_data.csv` data. Store it in `df`.  **Use your dataframe to answer the questions in Quiz 1 of the classroom.**
# 
# a. Read in the dataset and take a look at the top few rows here:

# In[2]:


df = pd.read_csv("ab_data.csv")
df.head()


# b. Use the cell below to find the number of rows in the dataset.

# In[3]:


df.shape


# c. The number of unique users in the dataset.

# In[4]:


df['user_id'].nunique()


# d. The proportion of users converted.

# In[5]:


df['converted'].mean()*100


# e. The number of times the `new_page` and `treatment` don't match.

# In[6]:


Number_of_times_donot_match = df.query("landing_page == 'new_page' and group == 'control'").shape[0]+df.query("landing_page == 'old_page' and group == 'treatment'").shape[0]
Number_of_times_donot_match


# f. Do any of the rows have missing values?

# In[7]:


df.isnull().any()


# `2.` For the rows where **treatment** does not match with **new_page** or **control** does not match with **old_page**, we cannot be sure if this row truly received the new or old page.  Use **Quiz 2** in the classroom to figure out how we should handle these rows.  
# 
# a. Now use the answer to the quiz to create a new dataset that meets the specifications from the quiz.  Store your new dataframe in **df2**.

# In[8]:


donot_match1 = df.query("landing_page == 'new_page' and group == 'control'")
donot_match2 = df.query("landing_page == 'old_page' and group == 'treatment'")
donot_match1
donot_match2
df2 = df.drop(donot_match1.index)
df2 = df2.drop(donot_match2.index)
df2.shape[0]


# In[9]:


# Double Check all of the correct rows were removed - this should be 0
df2[((df2['group'] == 'treatment') == (df2['landing_page'] == 'new_page')) == False].shape[0]


# `3.` Use **df2** and the cells below to answer questions for **Quiz3** in the classroom.

# a. How many unique **user_id**s are in **df2**?

# In[10]:


df2['user_id'].nunique()


# b. There is one **user_id** repeated in **df2**.  What is it?

# In[11]:


df2[df2.duplicated(['user_id'])]


# c. What is the row information for the repeat **user_id**? 

# In[12]:


df2[df2['user_id'] == 773192]


# d. Remove **one** of the rows with a duplicate **user_id**, but keep your dataframe as **df2**.

# In[13]:


df2 = df2.drop([2893])
df2[df2['user_id'] == 773192]


# In[14]:


sum(df2.duplicated())


# `4.` Use **df2** in the cells below to answer the quiz questions related to **Quiz 4** in the classroom.
# 
# a. What is the probability of an individual converting regardless of the page they receive?

# In[15]:


df2.converted.mean()


# b. Given that an individual was in the `control` group, what is the probability they converted?

# In[16]:


Control_Group_Converted = len(df2.query("group == 'control'  and converted == '1'"))/len(df2.query("group == 'control'"))
Control_Group_Converted


# c. Given that an individual was in the `treatment` group, what is the probability they converted?

# In[17]:


Treatment_Group_Converted = len(df2.query("group == 'treatment'  and converted == '1'"))/len(df2.query("group == 'control'"))
Treatment_Group_Converted


# d. What is the probability that an individual received the new page?

# In[18]:


(df2[df2['landing_page'] == 'new_page'].count()/(df2[df2['landing_page'] == 'new_page'].count()+df2[df2['landing_page'] == 'old_page'].count()))['landing_page']


# e. Consider your results from parts (a) through (d) above, and explain below whether you think there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the new treatment page leads to more conversions.

# **My answer:**

# Based on what was reached through part a to j , the number of users is approximately equal and is 0.5 for each group. Also, the control group is slightly higher, by 12.04%, than the tretmant group, which is 11.88%.So there is no robust evidence.

# <a id='ab_test'></a>
# ### Part II - A/B Test
# 
# Notice that because of the time stamp associated with each event, you could technically run a hypothesis test continuously as each observation was observed.  
# 
# However, then the hard question is do you stop as soon as one page is considered significantly better than another or does it need to happen consistently for a certain amount of time?  How long do you run to render a decision that neither page is better than another?  
# 
# These questions are the difficult parts associated with A/B tests in general.  
# 
# 
# `1.` For now, consider you need to make the decision just based on all the data provided.  If you want to assume that the old page is better unless the new page proves to be definitely better at a Type I error rate of 5%, what should your null and alternative hypotheses be?  You can state your hypothesis in terms of words or in terms of **$p_{old}$** and **$p_{new}$**, which are the converted rates for the old and new pages.

# **My answer:**
# 
# The null hypothesis it's to be the converted rate for new_page less than or equal old_page, which represented in form *$H_{0}$* : *$p_{new}$* <= **$p_{old}$** also in other way new_page minus old_page less than or equal zero, I assume it is true until proven otherwise.
# 
# The alternative hypothesis it's to be the converted rate for new_page greater than old_page, which represented in form *$H_{1}$* : *$p_{new}$* > **$p_{old}$** also in other way new_page minus old_page greater than zero, Which I am trying to prove it's true.
# 
# 

# `2.` Assume under the null hypothesis, $p_{new}$ and $p_{old}$ both have "true" success rates equal to the **converted** success rate regardless of page - that is $p_{new}$ and $p_{old}$ are equal. Furthermore, assume they are equal to the **converted** rate in **ab_data.csv** regardless of the page. <br><br>
# 
# Use a sample size for each page equal to the ones in **ab_data.csv**.  <br><br>
# 
# Perform the sampling distribution for the difference in **converted** between the two pages over 10,000 iterations of calculating an estimate from the null.  <br><br>
# 
# Use the cells below to provide the necessary parts of this simulation.  If this doesn't make complete sense right now, don't worry - you are going to work through the problems below to complete this problem.  You can use **Quiz 5** in the classroom to make sure you are on the right track.<br><br>

# a. What is the **conversion rate** for $p_{new}$ under the null? 

# In[19]:


P_New = df2.converted.mean()
P_New


# b. What is the **conversion rate** for $p_{old}$ under the null? <br><br>

# In[20]:


P_Old = df2.converted.mean()
P_Old


# c. What is $n_{new}$, the number of individuals in the treatment group?

# In[21]:


Number_New = df2[df2['landing_page'] == 'new_page'].count()['landing_page']
Number_New


# d. What is $n_{old}$, the number of individuals in the control group?

# In[22]:


Number_Old = df2[df2['landing_page'] == 'old_page'].count()['landing_page']
Number_Old


# e. Simulate $n_{new}$ transactions with a conversion rate of $p_{new}$ under the null.  Store these $n_{new}$ 1's and 0's in **new_page_converted**.

# In[23]:


#Simulate N_New transactions with a conversion rate of P_New under the null
New_Page_Converted = np.random.choice([1,0], Number_New, p=[P_New, 1-P_New])
New_Page_Converted


# f. Simulate $n_{old}$ transactions with a conversion rate of $p_{old}$ under the null.  Store these $n_{old}$ 1's and 0's in **old_page_converted**.

# In[24]:


#Simulate Number_Old transactions with a conversion rate of P_Old under the null
Old_Page_Converted = np.random.choice([1,0], Number_Old, p=[P_Old, 1-P_Old])
Old_Page_Converted


# g. Find $p_{new}$ - $p_{old}$ for your simulated values from part (e) and (f).

# In[25]:


#Calculating the between New_Page_Converted and Old_Page_Converted
Difference_Simulated_Values = New_Page_Converted.mean() - Old_Page_Converted.mean()
Difference_Simulated_Values


# h. Create 10,000 $p_{new}$ - $p_{old}$ values using the same simulation process you used in parts (a) through (g) above. Store all 10,000 values in a NumPy array called **p_diffs**.

# In[26]:


p_diffs = []
for _ in range(10000):
    p_diffs.append(np.random.choice([1,0],size=Number_New,p=[P_New,(1-P_New)]).mean() - np.random.choice([1,0],size=Number_Old,p=[P_Old,(1-P_Old)]).mean())
p_diffs = np.asarray(p_diffs)    


# i. Plot a histogram of the **p_diffs**.  Does this plot look like what you expected?  Use the matching problem in the classroom to assure you fully understand what was computed here.

# In[27]:


plt.hist(p_diffs)
plt.title("Page Diffrence")
plt.xlabel('Difference')
plt.ylabel('Frequency');


# j. What proportion of the **p_diffs** are greater than the actual difference observed in **ab_data.csv**?

# In[28]:


Actual_Difference = Treatment_Group_Converted - Control_Group_Converted
(p_diffs > Actual_Difference).mean()


# k. Please explain using the vocabulary you've learned in this course what you just computed in part **j.**  What is this value called in scientific studies?  What does this value mean in terms of whether or not there is a difference between the new and old pages?

# **My answer:**
# 
# In part j,I have calculated **p-value**. large p-value suggest we stick on the null hypothesis. So in this case the p-value high it's about 0.90 so based on that I could not reject the null hypothesis and I failed to prove the alternative hypothesis.
# which means the old_page it's doing better than or same as the new_page.
# 

# l. We could also use a built-in to achieve similar results.  Though using the built-in might be easier to code, the above portions are a walkthrough of the ideas that are critical to correctly thinking about statistical significance. Fill in the below to calculate the number of conversions for each page, as well as the number of individuals who received each page. Let `n_old` and `n_new` refer the the number of rows associated with the old page and new pages, respectively.

# In[29]:


import statsmodels.api as sm

convert_old = len(df2.query("group == 'control'  and converted == '1'"))
convert_new = len(df2.query("group == 'treatment'  and converted == '1'"))
convert_old,convert_new,Number_Old,Number_New


# m. Now use `stats.proportions_ztest` to compute your test statistic and p-value.  [Here](https://docs.w3cub.com/statsmodels/generated/statsmodels.stats.proportion.proportions_ztest/) is a helpful link on using the built in.

# In[30]:


z_score, p_value = sm.stats.proportions_ztest([convert_old, convert_new], [Number_Old, Number_New],alternative='smaller')
z_score, p_value


# In[31]:


#To know the critical value at 95% confidence interval
from scipy.stats import norm
norm.ppf(1-0.05) 


# n. What do the z-score and p-value you computed in the previous question mean for the conversion rates of the old and new pages?  Do they agree with the findings in parts **j.** and **k.**?

# **My answer:**
# 
# In part m,I have calculated z_score and p_value which support what I wrote above.Because the higher the p_value, the less evidence that the alternative hypothesis is true and this explains more what I wrote above. **In this case part m agree with part j and k** . which I could not reject the null hypothesis and that means the old_page doing better than or same as new_page. 

# <a id='regression'></a>
# ### Part III - A regression approach
# 
# `1.` In this final part, you will see that the result you achieved in the A/B test in Part II above can also be achieved by performing regression.<br><br> 
# 
# a. Since each row is either a conversion or no conversion, what type of regression should you be performing in this case?

# **My answer:**
# 
# Logistic Regression

# b. The goal is to use **statsmodels** to fit the regression model you specified in part **a.** to see if there is a significant difference in conversion based on which page a customer receives. However, you first need to create in df2 a column for the intercept, and create a dummy variable column for which page each user received.  Add an **intercept** column, as well as an **ab_page** column, which is 1 when an individual receives the **treatment** and 0 if **control**.

# In[32]:


#adding an intercept column and assign 1 as the value for each row in the column
df2['intercept'] = 1

#Create dummy variable column and assign 1 for treatment and 0 for control 
df2['ab_page'] = pd.get_dummies(df2['group'])['treatment']

df2.head(5)


# c. Use **statsmodels** to instantiate your regression model on the two columns you created in part b., then fit the model using the two columns you created in part **b.** to predict whether or not an individual converts. 

# In[33]:


logit_model = sm.Logit(df2['converted'], df2[['intercept', 'ab_page']])
#fiting the two columns I create above
results = logit_model.fit()


# d. Provide the summary of your model below, and use it as necessary to answer the following questions.

# In[34]:


results.summary2()


# e. What is the p-value associated with **ab_page**? Why does it differ from the value you found in **Part II**?<br><br>  **Hint**: What are the null and alternative hypotheses associated with your regression model, and how do they compare to the null and alternative hypotheses in **Part II**?

# **My answer:**
# 
# p-value associated with ab_page is 0.1899. It's different from p-value in Part II, Because the hypothesis is different in logistic regression it's based on a binary test. The null hypothesis the old_page equal to the new_page. The alternative if they are not equal.

# f. Now, you are considering other things that might influence whether or not an individual converts.  Discuss why it is a good idea to consider other factors to add into your regression model.  Are there any disadvantages to adding additional terms into your regression model?

# **My answer:**
# 
# Yes I believe it's good idea to considering some vactors such as age or specific cultural behavior,But some time it may not be good idea because we may add factor may not have influences to our regression model.

# g. Now along with testing if the conversion rate changes for different pages, also add an effect based on which country a user lives in. You will need to read in the **countries.csv** dataset and merge together your datasets on the appropriate rows.  [Here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.join.html) are the docs for joining tables. 
# 
# Does it appear that country had an impact on conversion?  Don't forget to create dummy variables for these country columns - **Hint: You will need two columns for the three dummy variables.** Provide the statistical output as well as a written response to answer this question.

# In[35]:


New_Dataset = pd.read_csv('countries.csv')
New_Dataset.head(5)


# In[36]:


#Merge the New_Dataset with df2
df2_Updated = df2.join(New_Dataset.set_index('user_id'),on ='user_id')
df2_Updated.head(10)


# In[37]:


df2_Updated[['CA','UK','US']] = pd.get_dummies(df2_Updated['country'])
df2_Updated.head(10)


# In[46]:


#adding an intercept column and assign 1 as the value for each row in the column
df2_Updated['intercept'] = 1

logit_model = sm.Logit(df2_Updated['converted'],df2_Updated[['intercept','CA','US']])
results = logit_model.fit()
results.summary2()


# **My ansewr:**
# 
# Based on that the p-value for CA and US are above 0.05,So the countries do not affect the conversion rates.
# Also, now I could not reject the null hypothesis.

# h. Though you have now looked at the individual factors of country and page on conversion, we would now like to look at an interaction between page and country to see if there significant effects on conversion.  Create the necessary additional columns, and fit the new model.  
# 
# Provide the summary results, and your conclusions based on the results.

# In[47]:


df2_Updated['US_ab_page'] = df2_Updated['US'] * df2_Updated['ab_page']
df2_Updated['UK_ab_page'] = df2_Updated['UK'] * df2_Updated['ab_page']
df2_Updated.head(10)


# In[48]:


log_model = sm.Logit(df2_Updated['converted'], df2_Updated[['intercept','ab_page','UK','US','US_ab_page', 'UK_ab_page']])
results = log_model.fit()
results.summary2()


# In[49]:


np.exp(results.params)


# **Summary Results**: Based on the results above, the interaction between US and UK with ab_page almost equal chance so there is no influences on the conversion rates.So I failed to reject the null hypothesis.

# ## Conclusion:
# 
# I used three ways to know the page that has the highest performance between the old_page and new_page, All of them lead to that 
# the old_page performs almost the same as the new_page, or with a tiny difference. So I advise to stay on the old_page and save time, effort and money.
